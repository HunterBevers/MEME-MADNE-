MEME MADNESS

MEME MADNESS is a fun, chaotic website designed to bring humor and randomness to your day. With a film noir-style background featuring Trollface and colorful LSD effects, it’s all about the wild, meme-filled experience. The site features buttons for generating dark humor memes, funny stories, and YouTube links, as well as a playful Illuminati feature for saving memes directly to your device.

Features

- Generate Meme: Click to reveal a random dark humor meme (gif, jpeg, or png) from a large collection of hundreds of memes.
- Generate Story: This button generates random funny stories from a predefined list, though it’s currently being updated.
- Generate YouTube Link: Displays a clickable YouTube link to a random, dark-humor video (think the "dad left for milk" meme).
- Save Meme: Drag and drop a meme onto the Illuminati icon in the bottom right to save it to your device.
- Navigation: Easily navigate between the Home, About, and Contact pages. The About page features a Doge meme background, while the Contact page uses a Trollface in a suit.
